Dynamic Programming Notes:

Memoization
    1. Make it work
        visiualize problem as a tree
        implement tree using recursion
    2. Make it efficient
        add a memoization object
        add a base case to return memoization values
        store return values in the memoization object
        Examine the recursion tree to see if there is duplicate work anywhere

Tabulation
    1. Visualize problem as a table
    2. Size of the tabke is based on the inputs
    3. Initialize the table with default values
    4. Seed the trivial answer into the table
    5. Iterate through the table
    6. Fill further positions based on the current position
