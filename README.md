# algorithm_review
A repository based on [codding_interview_university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university)

For each topic, I will be writing implementations in:
* C, using structs (and structs as the first argument in any related functions)
* C++, without the STL
* C++, with the STL
* Python, using built-in types
* Java, using built-in types

While reviewing each topic, I will be taking flashcard notes in [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
I will be attempting to review these flashcards every week or so.
